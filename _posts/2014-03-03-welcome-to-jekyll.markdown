This was our first code night in a while, we ate samosas and ordered pizza :)

1. Demoed the results of the two teams at McHacks
  * [NESP](http://mchacks.challengepost.com/submissions/21221-nesp)
  * [One Small Leap](http://mchacks.challengepost.com/submissions/21221-nesp)
2. Started working on the [3 challenges](https://github.com/SMU-CS-and-Math-Society/MidtermDefragNight) set for this week. 


Feel free to attempt the challenges yourself! Fork the repo, and when completed make a pull request.
